# Diabetes-Prediction

# Overview
A personal Machine Learning model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on various features extracted from health data

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on various health-related features. The model is designed to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and intervention.

# Features
*Datasets:* The model has been trained on two different datasets:
1) PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset (originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, under the CC0 : Public Domain License)
2) Diabetes Prediction Dataset (taken from https://www.kaggle.com/iammustafatz)

*Algorithms:* The model has been trained on various state-of-the-algorithms (such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour, Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes) for the two aforementioned datasets with varying results.

*Evaluation:*
